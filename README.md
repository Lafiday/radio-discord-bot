# radio-discord-bot
A simple yet functional radio application using ytdl core and discord.js v14.

It is currently in beta and may contain bugs.

When putting the video url in the config.json, remember to use the default search url. Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CErjs8F9xQQ

Remembering that live plays can contain crashes, if you want a longer playback, use lives that have already ended or for example videos of more than 1 hour. And don't worry, he'll never stop playing

After forking the project use: npm install
